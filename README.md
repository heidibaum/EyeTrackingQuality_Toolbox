# EyeTrackingQuality_Toolbox
R Markdown script for quantifying eye tracking data quality

This is an R Markdown-formatted tool for quantifying quality metrics of raw, Hz-level eye tracking data. It was created to use with data exported from SensoMotoric Instruments' BeGaze software. 

The toolbox provides visualizations that allow the user to visualize differences in data quantity (tracking ratio) and quality (deviations in estimated point-of-reference from known validation locations) by eye. Using these metrics, the toolbox makes a subject-level recommendation to the user of which eye (left or right) should be used for subsequent analyses. 

To use the toolbox, download the ETQuality_Toolbox directory and follow the instructions in the User Guide.
